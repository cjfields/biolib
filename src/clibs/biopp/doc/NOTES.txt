Notes on compiling the Bio++ modules in the Biolib framework.


== Check-out the biopp git submodule ==

The submodules are defined in ./.gitmodules. There should be an entry
like:

  [submodule "contrib/biopp"]
        path = contrib/biopp
        url = git://github.com/pjotrp/biopp.git

and another for the cmake modules:

  [submodule "tools/cmake-support"]
        path = tools/cmake-support
        url = git://github.com/pjotrp/cmake-support.git

In the root do:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

And the biopp sub-repository should be in ./contrib/biopp


== Building the C++ libraries ==

The control files for building the Bio++ C libraries are in
./src/clibs/biopp/

  cd ./src/clibs/biopp/src/
  rm CMakeCache.txt ; cmake . ; make 
 
should build a shared library in ./src/clibs/biopp/build. This is the
library we link against. (Note: As Bio++ has namespaces we can build one
single .so file). It is named something like
libbiolib_biopp-0.0.5.so, where the version number reflects the
biolib repository VERSION.


== Creating Python bindings ==

The Python mapping happens in ./src/mappings/swig/python/biopp. Key
is the python_biopp.i file, which includes all the others.
